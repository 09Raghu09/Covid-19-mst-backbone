week_2_spreading_models;10 3390/ijerph16234683;Infectious diseases are an important cause of human death  The study of the pathogenesis  spread regularity  and development trend of infectious diseases not only provides a theoretical basis for future research on infectious diseases  but also has practical guiding significance for the prevention and control of their spread  In this paper  a controlled differential equation and an objective function of infectious diseases were established by mathematical modeling  Based on cellular automata theory and a compartmental model  the SLIRDS (Susceptible-Latent-Infected-Recovered-Dead-Susceptible) model was constructed  a model which can better reflect the actual infectious process of infectious diseases  Considering the spread of disease in different populations  the model combines population density  sex ratio  and age structure to set the evolution rules of the model  Finally  on the basis of the SLIRDS model  the complex spread process of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) was simulated  The simulation results are similar to the macroscopic characteristics of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) in real life  thus the accuracy and rationality of the SLIRDS model are confirmed ;"Infectious diseases are diseases that can be transmitted from person to person  from person to animal  or from animal to animal after proto-microorganisms and parasites infect human beings or animals [1–3]  Infectivity  epidemic  and uncertainty are the three main characteristics of infectious diseases  A thorough study of the spread causes  spread routes  spread processes  and epidemic laws of infectious diseases is the main method for effective prevention  control  and elimination of infectious diseases  At present  the mathematical study of infectious diseases is mainly based on the theory and method of infectious disease dynamics [4–6]  The essence of infectious disease dynamics is to establish a mathematical model that can reflect the spread process  spread law  and spread trend of infectious diseases  Its advantage is that  according to the characteristics of infectious diseases  the model of infectious diseases is reasonably assumed  the appropriate parameters are set  and the appropriate variables are selected  Then  the dynamic characteristics of infectious diseases can be clearly revealed  It has laid a solid foundation for further analysis of the causes and key factors of the spread of infectious diseases  and for seeking the optimal strategies for the prevention and control of such diseases  The main method to study and forecast the spread mechanism of infectious diseases is to establish mathematical models  Some of these are used to study the general laws of infectious diseases  while others are used to study specific infectious diseases  such as HFMD (Hand foot and mouth disease)  tuberculosis  AIDS  and so on  In 1760  Bernoulli [7] began using mathematical models to study the spread of smallpox by vaccination  In 1906  Hamer [8] constructed and analyzed a discrete time model for the study of recurrent measles epidemics  In 1927  Kermack and McKendrick [9] proposed the SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) compartmental model for the first time in order to study the epidemic law of the Black Death prevailing in Europe at that time  On the basis of the SIR model’s analysis  the ""threshold theory"" was proposed to distinguish the spread or regression of the disease  The validity of the SIR model has been proven by the data regarding large-scale infectious diseases in history  thus the deterministic model [10] based on a differential equation has been widely accepted  With the deepening of research  the factors involved in establishing the mathematical model are increasing  and the dimension of the model is also increasing  Based on the classical SIR model  Aron and Schwartz [11] proposed the SEIR(Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Recovered) model in 1984  That model considers that the latency of infectious diseases also has an impact on infectious diseases  so the model is more realistic  Focusing on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) infectious disease spread in recent years  Safi and Gumel [12] constructed
the SEQIJR(Susceptible-Exposed-Quarantine-Infective-Isolation-Recovered) model according to the characteristics of SARS  Small and Chi [13] studied the effects of vaccination and isolation on the SARS epidemic and constructed the SEIRP (Susceptible-Exposed- Infective- Recovered-Persevered) model  In addition  some researchers start with the population structure of infectious disease spread and study the spread model of infectious disease  According to the influence of age on the spread of infectious diseases  Boklund et al  [14] proposed a model to better characterize the effect of age heterogeneity on the spread of infectious diseases  According to the difference in population  Meng et al  [15] divided the population into different groups  and they proved the global stability of disease-free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium  With the development of artificial intelligence  the network dynamics model has gradually become a new research method of infectious disease model  The most common network dynamics models include the ordinary differential equation model  the discrete differential equation model  the impulsive differential equation model  and the differential equation model with time delay  The main methods are finite equation theory  matrix theory  bifurcation theory  K-order monotone system theory  central manifold theory  Lasalle invariant principle  etc  However  these research methods are all theoretical studies on infectious diseases  but it is difficult to apply them to practical problems 
The concept of cellular automata was proposed in the 1940s  Cellular automata can be described as a dynamic system consisting of a transformation function in cellular space  which is discrete in time and space  The cellular automata model can be formally expressed as CA = (LC  S M  f )  where CA represents the cellular automaton system  LC represents the mesh space which is divided according to given rules  a mesh corresponding to a cell of cellular automata  S represents the set of cell states  M = (C1 C2  : : :  Cn) represents the set of current cell adjacent to cells  and f represents the transformation function which can transform Cn to C  the function that can calculate the state of cell C at t + 1 time according to the state of adjacent cells of cell C at t time  Adjacent cells are Moore neiIgnth  Jb  oEnrvsirwon i tRhes r Paudbliiuc Hse=alth1  20A19s  1s6h  xo wn in Figure 1  cells can move in eight directions  Misra et al  [16] gave a comprehensive introduction to the theory and application of cellular automata  Since the 1990s  epidemic spread models based on cellular automata [17–20] have been extensively studied  According to the characteristics and mechanism of AIDS  Pan et al  [21] proposed a spread model of AIDS based on cellular automata  López et al  [22] proposed an epidemic spread
model based on cellular automata that considers individual heterogeneity  population mobility ratio  and individual maximum moving distance  Because cellular automata can perform some experiments that cannot be done in real life by modeling  we can analyze the actual situation and obtain the results  in order to solve the complex problems that cannot be dealt with in the deterministic model  It is thus becoming a typical representative of the network dynamics model  Based on the ability of cellular automata to model complex problems  this paper considered that  in real society  population mobility is caused by economic development  living environment  education level  and other factors  and that population density  sex ratio  and age structure of area also have some influence on the spread of infectious diseases  An epidemic spread model Susceptible-Latent-Infected-Recovered-Dead-Susceptible (SLIRDS) based on cellular automata was therefore established  The contributions of our research are as follows: _ A more realistic epidemic spread model based on cellular automata was established and achieved good results in simulation experiments  _ The effects of population density  sex ratio  and age structure on the spread of infectious diseases were discussed  and the simulation results were analyzed to observe the effects of the above three factors on the spread process of infectious diseases  _ The suggestions given in this paper based on the three influencing factors provided strong support for researchers to study the spread process of infectious diseases in different environments  The rest of this paper is organized as follows  The methodology of our research is introduced in Section 2  Simulation results and analysis are given in Section 3  Discussions are presented in Section 4  Finally  conclusions are given in Section 5 
2  Methodology 2 1  SLIRDS Model On the basis of the SIR and SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) models  the state of the population was divided into susceptible  latent  infected  recovered  and dead  The total number of members of the population is denoted as N(t)  S(t) represents susceptible population  meaning the number of members of the population who are not infected but are susceptible to infection at time t  Latent population is denoted as L(t)  meaning the number of members of the population infected at time t but not yet affected  and at this time the individual is not infectious  Infected population is denoted as I(t)  meaning the number of members of the population who are infected and have infectivity at time t  Recovered population is denoted as R(t)  meaning the number of members of the population who are immune at t time and will not be infected for a certain period of time  Dead population is denoted as D(t)  meaning the number of members of the population who died of infectious diseases at time t  and individuals are not infectious at the moment  The SLIRDS  model can be described through the following differential equation models: where _ represents the proportion of the population who lost immunity to the infectious disease  _ is the ratio coefficient of the infection rate  ! is the latency ratio coefficient of the infectious disease   is the ratio coefficient of the recovered infected population  and io and so represent the ratio of infected and susceptible individuals in the initial population  respectively  The transition relationships of states in the SLIRDS model are shown in Figure 2  In order to simulate the phenomenon of crowd movement in the real world  this paper introduced the idea of random walk cellular automata to simulate individual movement in the crowd  Considering the limitation of individual movement  the maximum step length L is set for individual movement  At the same time  considering the individual activity m  all individuals are scanned randomly in each time step  and the individuals whose proportion is m are selected  di and dj (jdij  ___ dj____ L) are chosen randomly for each selected individual C(i j)  and then C(i j) and C(i+di j+dj) are exchanged to complete the individual movement  In the paper  the SLIRDS epidemic model based on cellular automata is proposed  Assuming that the environment of the crowd is a regular N = n _ n mesh space  a sparse matrix whose density is _ = Cn/N (Cn is the set of individuals) is generated randomly  Each non-zero element of the matrix represents an e_ective individual  M represents the neighbor set of cellular nodes  and it uses a Moore
neighbor with radius = 1  S(i j)(t) = f0  1  2  3  4g is used to represent the cell state in the i-th row and the j-th column at time t  Di_erent values represent di_erent states as follows: Si j)(t) = 1 represents susceptible state  meaning that individuals are not infected and they are immune to this infectious disease; S(i j)(t) = 2 represents latent state  meaning that individuals have been infected  but they do not have infectivity; S(i j)(t) = 3 represents infected state  meaning that individuals are infected and infectious; S(i j)(t) = 4 represents recovered state  meaning that individuals have recovered and acquired immunity within a certain period of time; S(i j)(t) = 0 represents dead state  meaning that individuals are dead and they do not have infectivity  Because cellular automata cannot reflect every individual’s and their neighbors’ randomness  unified parameters T1  T2  and T3 are introduced  T1 representing the maximum peak of latency time for each individual  T2 representing the maximum peak of illness time for each individual  and T3 representing the maximum peak of immunization time for each individual  T1 _S(i j)(t)_ represents latency time of the individual  T2 _S(i j)(t) _ represents illness time of the individual  and T3 _S(i j)(t) _ represents immunization time of the individual  2 2  Influence Analysis of Different Factors on Infectious Disease Spread Because of heterogeneity among individuals  each individual shows different resistance  infectivity  and infectious range to disease  This paper considers the effects of population density  sex ratio  and age structure on infectious disease spread in the population  and discusses the influence of different factors on infectious disease spread  2 2 1  Population Density  Sex Ratio  and Age Structure In real life  because there are differences in climate  economy  education  and medical treatment  the population is not divided by rules like cellular automata  For example  in China  the population density in the southeast coastal areas is greater than that in the northwest  In addition  because of the different distribution of business districts  schools  and hospitals  the distribution of population in the same city is not uniform  In areas with a large population density  the distance between individuals is shorter and the spread range of individuals is wider  Individuals in the population have higher contact frequency and more neighbors around them  so their infectivity and the probability of being infected also increase  In order to study and analyze the influence of population density on infectious disease spread  each individual is mapped into a cell in the cellular automata model  When there is no individual and the individual is in dead state in a cell  they are not infectious  In order to simulate the difference in population density  the population density can be simulated by setting the value of D(t) in the initial state  At this time  D(t) does not represent the number of dead individuals  but represents that there is no individual in the cell  In this paper  a sparse matrix was used to simulate the random distribution of population and the infectious disease spread  and then the trend of infectious disease spread under different population densities as well as the influence of different population densities on infectious disease spread were analyzed  Due to the influence of economic development and other factors  the population ratio and age structure in different regions are also different  For example  young and middle-aged people in remote mountainous areas go to work in big cities  resulting in a large number of old and young people in the original area  In areas where labor is scarce  such as coal mines and crude oil mining areas  there is an imbalance in the proportion of men to women  Therefore  it is of great practical significance to study the influence of sex ratio and age structure on infectious disease spread  2 2 2  Individual Heterogeneity In real life  because of different living environments  living habits  resistance levels to viruses  infectious abilities to diseases  levels of drug resistance  and spread ranges  and in order to simulate the spread mechanism of infectious diseases more accurately  it is particularly important to consider individual heterogeneity  establish an infectious disease spread model  and further analyze and predict the spread mechanism of the epidemic situation  In this paper  the probability of infection P(i j)(t) was used to describe individual heterogeneity  Individual heterogeneity is determined by the individual’s resistance to disease and the infectivity of neighbor cells  The state of neighbor cells of cell C(i j) at (i  j) can be expressed by an adjacency matrix as follows: After three times spread  its adjacency matrix is defined as follows: The infection rate of cell C(i j) at time t is defined as follows: where PC(i j) C(k l)(t) is used to describe the probability of cell C(i j) infected by cell C(k l) at time t  Because the probability of infection is inversely proportional to one’s own resistance  it is proportional to the infectivity of one’s neighbors  Thus  it can be expressed as follows: where fC(i j) C(k l) represents the infectivity of cell C(k l) to cell C(i j) (because of the difference in the constitution of different individuals  they have different infectivity and resistance) and fC(i j) C(k l)
obeys (0 1) uniform distribution [23]  RC(i j) represents the infectious disease resistance of cell C(i j)  Some diseases have different influences on different sex and age groups  that is  individual sex and age differences are also important factors affecting an individual’s resistance to disease  Thus  it can be expressed as follows: where gm and gf represent the proportion of males and females in the population  fm and f f represent the influence coe_cient of infectious diseases on males and females  y1  : : :   yn are the proportion of various age groups in the population  f1  : : :   fn are the influence coe_cient of infectious diseases on n groups of populations  and TC(i j) obeys (0 1) uniform distribution [23]  The infection probability of each individual is determined by its own resistance to infectious diseases and the infectivity of its neighbors  At each time step  the individual state is updated synchronously  2 2 3  Model Evolution Rules According to a given population density  the sparse matrix is generated to simulate the distribution of population  and then through the age structure and sex ratio  each individual sets their attribute values  The initial state of all individuals is set to S = 1  the state of the infected individuals is set to S = 2  Individuals in cells are updated according to the following rules: (1) When S(i j)(t) = 1  individual infection probability P(i j)(t) is calculated  and then whether the individual will be transformed into S(i j)(t) = 2 is determined  Otherwise  S(i j)(t) = 1  Meanwhile  individual latency time T1 _S(i j)(t)_= T1 _S(i j)(t)_+ 1 
(2) When S(i j)(t) = 2  when T1_S(i j)(t)_< T1  S(i j)(t + 1) = 2  Otherwise  S(i j)(t + 1) = 3  Meanwhile  individual illness time T2 _S(i j)(t)_= T2_S(i j)(t)_+ 1 (3) When S(i j)(t) = 3  when T2_S(i j)(t)_< T2  S(i j)(t + 1) = 3  Otherwise  the individual enters into dead state with probability _  and S(i j)(t + 1) = 0; the rest of individuals have recovered and acquired immunity  and S(i j)(t + 1) = 4  Meanwhile  individual immunization time T3 _S(i j)(t)_= T3_S(i j)(t)_+ 1  (4) When 𝑆(􀯜 􀯝)(𝑡) = 4  when 𝑇􀬷(𝑆(􀯜 􀯝)(𝑡)) ≥ 𝑇􀬷  individual immunity to the infectious disease disappears with probability 𝛿  The individual then turns into susceptible state  𝑆(􀯜 􀯝)(𝑡) = 1  (5) At each time step  all individuals move  3  Simulation Results and Analysis Without considering other factors  this paper focused on the influence of three factors  namely  population density  individual heterogeneity  and mobility on infectious disease spread  and the SLIRDS model based on cellular automata was constructed  In order to verify the validity of the model  this paper took pandemic influenza A (H1N1) as an example to simulate the spread process of pandemic influenza A (H1N1)  In this paper  we used MATLAB simulation software (R2013b  MathWorks  Natick  MA  USA) to carry out 200 simulation experiments; the simulated curves are realizations of the average from all simulations  According to the latent and infectious characteristics of pandemic influenza A (H1N1)  the time step of simulation is in days  and the total time is set to T = 40  The simulated initial number of members of the infected population was consistent with the actual number of members of the infected population  and we assumed that the proportion of the initial latent population was 0 15%  First  the number of members of the infected population in the SLIRDS model simulation experiments was compared with the actual data of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) in Beijing in Mainland China (June–July 2009) [24]  The comparison results are shown in Figure 3  In Figure 3  the abscissa is the time step of simulation and the ordinate is the number of infected individuals  The correlation coefficient of the two sets of data is 0 97215 by t-test  It shows that the simulation results are close to the actual data and that the model is reasonable and effective  3 1  Influence of Population Density on Infectious Disease Spread All things being equal  the parameters of two simulations for the SLIRDS model were set as follows: (1) Population density _ = 1  susceptible population:latent population:infected population =0 872:0 107:0 021  (2) Population density _ = 0 8  susceptible population:latent population:infected population = 0 6985:0 0855:0 016  Two simulation results are shown in Figure 4  In Figure 4  considering the difference in population base  the number of members of the population that died  were susceptible  were infected  and were immunized was replaced by death  susceptibility  infection and immunization rates to describe the changes in population in different states  From the death rate curve in Figure 4a  it can be seen that the death rate increases with the increase of population density  but the overall trend is rising and tending to be stable  From the susceptibility rate curve in Figure 4b  it can be seen that the change in population density has little influence on the susceptible population  and the susceptibility will first decrease and then reach a stable value when the population density is large  From the infection rate curve in Figure 4c  it can be seen that the change in population density has little influence on the infected population  When the population density is large  the number of members of the infected population is greater  but the general trend is rising first  then falling  and finally tends to be stable  From the immunization rate curve in Figure 4d  it can be seen that the change in population density has little influence on the immune population  When the population density is large  the immunity first rises and then reaches a stable value  According to the above analysis  it is known that when the population density is large  the spread rate of infectious diseases is faster  3 2 1  Influence of Infectious Disease Spread under Different Coefficients All things being equal  the ratio of males to females was 4:1  The parameters of two simulations for the SLIRDS model were set as follows: (1) The influence coefficients of infectious disease on males and females were 0 1 and 0 9  respectively  (2) The influence coefficients of infectious disease on males and females were 0 9 and 0 1  respectively  Two simulation results are shown in Figure 5  As shown in Figure 5a  we can see that when infectious diseases have a greater influence on males  the number of deaths is higher  but the overall trend is rising and gradually stable  As shown in Figure 5b  we can see that infectious diseases have less influence on susceptible population under different influence coefficients; when infectious diseases have a greater influence on females  the number of members of the susceptible population first decreases and then reaches a stable value  As shown in Figure 5c  we can see that infectious diseases have less influence on infected population under different influence coefficients; when infectious diseases have a greater influence on males  the number of members of the susceptible population first decreases and then reaches a stable value  However  the overall trend is first rising and then falling  and finally tends to be stable  As shown in Figure 5d  we can see that infectious diseases have less influence on recovered population under different influence coefficients; when infectious diseases have greater influence on males  the number of members of the susceptible population increases first  and then reaches a stable value  According to the above analysis  it is known that in cities with more males than females  when the infectious disease has a great influence on males  infectious diseases have a greater influence on the population because of the large population base of males  Similarly  there are corresponding phenomena in cities with more females than males  3 2 2  Influence of Infectious Disease Spread under Different Sex Ratios According to related materials [24]  the influence coefficient of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) on males and females is very different  In simulation experiments  the influence coefficients of pandemic influenzaA (H1N1) on males and females were set to gm = 0 55  gf = 0 35  respectively  The parameters of two simulations for the SLIRDS model were set as follows: (1) The ratio of males to females is 4:1  (2) The ratio of males to females is 1:4  Two simulation results are shown in Figure 6  From the death curve in Figure 6a  we can see that when the number of males is large  the number of deaths is higher  but the overall trend is rising and gradually stable  From the susceptibility curve in Figure 6b  we can see that under different sex ratios  infectious diseases have little influence on susceptible population  When the number of females is large  the number of members of the susceptible population first decreases and then reaches a stable value  From the infection curve in Figure 6c  we can see that under different sex ratios  infectious diseases have little influence on the infected population  When the number of males is large  the number of members of the infected population decreases first and then reaches a stable value  From the immunization curve in Figure 6d  we can see that under different sex ratios  infectious diseases have little influence on the immunization population  When the number of males is large  the number of members of the immunization population increases first  and then reaches a stable value  According to the above analysis  it is known that when the number of males is larger in the cities where infectious diseases affect men more  infectious diseases have a greater influence on the population  3 3  Influence of Age Structure on Infectious Disease Spread Due to factors such as mobility and spatial environment  age structure of the population presents
different distributions  The age structure of a city can be divided into three types: young  adult  and aged according to the proportion of children  adolescents  youth  middle-aged people  and elderly people  According to related materials [24]  the influence coefficient of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) on children  adolescents  youth  middle-aged people  and elderly people is very different  In simulation experiments  the influence coefficients of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) on children  adolescents  youth  middle-aged people  and elderly people were set to f1 = 0 65  f2 = 0 58  f3 = 0 46  f4 = 0 37  f5 =0 68  respectively  All things being equal  the parameters of three simulations for the SLIRDS model were set as follows: (1) Young: children: adolescents: youth: middle age: old age = 0 025:0 05:0 5:0 4:0 025  (2) Adult: children: adolescents: youth: middle age: old age = 0 2:0 2:0 3:0 25:0 15  (3) Aged: children: adolescents: youth: middle age: old age = 0 1:0 05:0 05:0 2:0 6  Three simulation results are shown in Figure 7  The death  susceptibility  infection  and immunization curves are shown in Figure 7a–d  respectively  It can be seen that the number of deaths in the aged cities is the largest  The number of young urban deaths is only inferior to that of the aged cities  whereas the number of deaths in the adult cities is the least  However  the overall trend of change is gradually stable after rising for all types of cities  The difference in age structure of the population has little influence on the susceptible population  and the number of members of the susceptible population in adult cities decreases first and then reaches a stable value  The difference in age structure of the population has little influence on the infected population  The number of members of the infected population in the aged cities is the highest  but the general trend is rising first and then decreasing for all types of cities  The difference in age structure of the population has little influence on the immunization population  and the number of immune individuals in the adult city rises first to then reach a stable level  According to the above analysis  it is known that infectious diseases spread more slowly in adult cities than in aged and young cities  but the resistance of young cities to infectious diseases is slightly greater than that of aged cities  In this paper  we used the idea of a sparse matrix to add population density  sex ratio  and age structure factors into the SLIRDS model  Population density was set to 1 and 0 8  respectively  All things
being equal  with the increase of population density  infectious diseases spread faster  and infectious diseases have a greater influence on the population  When analyzing the influence of sex ratio on the spread of infectious diseases  we considered two factors  namely  different influence coefficient and different sex ratio  First  the ratio of males to females was set to 4:1  Because of the large population base of males  infectious diseases have a greater influence on the population when the infection coefficient is greater  Second  the influence coefficients of infectious diseases on males and females were 0 9 and 0 2  respectively  Because infectious diseases have a greater influence on males  when the number of males is larger  the influence of infectious diseases on the population is greater  When analyzing the influence of age structure on the spread of infectious diseases  we simulated three types of population distribution structure  namely  young  adult  and aged  according to the age structure distribution ratio  The number of members of the infected population and deaths in the aged cities were the largest  and the susceptibility of adult cities to infectious diseases was stronger  That is  the uniform distribution of age plays a more active role in the spread of infectious diseases  In order to effectively prevent the spread of infectious diseases in the population  we offer three suggestions according to the three influencing factors  (1) Population density: the regional economy should be balanced  the large-scale turnover of personnel should be reduced  the density of urban population should be controlled  the population in densely populated areas such as schools should be evacuated during the epidemic period of infectious diseases  (2) Sex ratio: when infectious disease has a greater influence on a certain sex  or if the sex ratio is larger in the population  attention should be paid to prevention and treatment with respect to that sex  (3) Age structure: the age structure should be optimized and the age structure of the city should be stabilized  On this basis  we should pay attention to prevention and treatment with respect to disadvantaged groups (such as the elderly and children) in the spread of infectious diseases  Many factors affect the spread of infectious diseases  This paper only studied the influence of the above three factors on the spread of infectious diseases  The many factors that must be further
explored in the future include the following: first  the influence of population activity on the spread of infectious diseases; second  the influence of population size on the spread of infectious diseases; and third  in view of the analysis of the influence factors  how to implement effective prevention and control measures against the spread of infectious diseases in specific cities  5  Conclusions In order to study the main factors that affect the spread process of infectious diseases  the SLIRDS model was proposed in this paper  Combined with cellular automata  an epidemic model based on cellular automata was established  In the simulation experiment  the influence of population density  sex ratio  and age structure on infectious disease spread was analyzed by comparing the results with those from the actual spread process of pandemic influenza A (H1N1)  and the accuracy of the SLIRDS model was confirmed  With research on the spread of infectious diseases  the advantage of using cellular automata to model complex problems can be used to optimize epidemic models  The system can better analyze the factors affecting the spread of infectious diseases  and provide better theoretical support for the prevention and control of infectious diseases  Because cellular automata cannot reflect every individual’s and their neighbors’ randomness  there was a lack of individual randomness in the SLIRDS model for the maximum peak of each state for the different durations  This will be the direction that we take in the future to focus on improvement

week_2_risk;10 3390/jcm9020571;We developed a computational tool to assess the risks of novel coronavirus outbreaks outside of China  We estimate the dependence of the risk of a major outbreak in a country from imported cases on key parameters such as: (i) the evolution of the cumulative number of cases in mainland China outside the closed areas  (ii) the connectivity of the destination country with China  including baseline travel frequencies  the effect of travel restrictions  and the efficacy of entry screening at destination  and (iii) the efficacy of control measures in the destination country (expressed by the local reproduction number Rloc)  We found that in countries with low connectivity to China but with relatively high Rloc  the most beneficial control measure to reduce the risk of outbreaks is a further reduction in their importation number either by entry screening or travel restrictions  Countries with high connectivity but low Rloc benefit the most from policies that further reduce Rloc  Countries in the middle should consider a combination of such policies  Risk assessments were illustrated for selected groups of countries from America  Asia  and Europe  We investigated how their risks depend on those parameters  and how the risk is increasing in time as the number of cases in China is growing ;"A cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan  China  was reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on 31 December 2019  The cause of the pneumonia cases was identified as a novel betacoronavirus  the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV  recently renamed as SARS-CoV-2  the cause of coronavirus disease COVID-19)  The first patient showing symptoms was recorded by Chinese authorities on 8 December 2019 [1]  On 9 January 2020  WHO confirmed that a novel coronavirus had been isolated from one of the hospitalized persons [2]  and the first death case was reported on the same day  The first case outside China was witnessed on 13 January in Thailand [3]  and in the following days  several other countries also reported 2019-nCoV cases [4]  The first confirmed cases in China  but outside Hubei province  were reported on 19 January  [4]  As of 1 February  there were 14 628 confirmed cases worldwide (out of which 14 451 happened in China) with 305 total deaths [5]  Since no specific antiviral agent is available for treatment of this infection  and there is no vaccine [6]  the control measures  introduced both in China and other countries  aimed to prevent the transmission  A metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and nearby cities was introduced on 23–24 January [7]  Several airports and train stations have started temperature screening measures to identify people with fevers [8]  All public transportation was suspended In Wuhan from 10 a m   23 January  including all outbound trains and flights  and all bus  metro and ferry lines  additionally  all outbound trains and flights were halted [9]  Construction of a specialist emergency hospital was started in Wuhan [10]  and nearly 6000 medical workers were sent to Wuhan from across China [11]  Beijing also announced the suspension of all inter-provincial bus and train services  several touristic attractions  including the Forbidden City and Shanghai Disneyland were closed [9]  Other countries also introduced control measures  including screening passengers arriving from China and closing their borders [12]  Several airlines  including British Airways and Lufthansa  canceled all flights to and from mainland China [9]  The potential dangers of 2019-nCoV have prompted a number of studies on its epidemiological characteristics  The 2018 travel data from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) were used to identify the countries and their infectious disease vulnerability indexes (IDVIs) [13]  which received substantial travel inflow from Wuhan Tianhe International Airport [14]  The IDVI has a range of 0–1  with a higher score implying lower vulnerability  The top destinations  Bangkok  Hong Kong  Tokyo and Taipei  all have an IDVI above 0 65  It is essential to estimate the number of infections (including those that have not been diagnosed)  to be able to analyze the spread of the disease  To that end  data on exported infections and individual-based mobility models were used by several researchers  obtaining comparable numbers  For 17 January 2020  preliminary estimates were given for various scenarios in the range 350–8400 by Chinazzi et al  for the total number of infections up to that date [15]  Imai et al  [16] also estimated the total number of infections in China and warned that the number is likely to substantially exceed that of the officially confirmed cases (see also [17])  They reported an estimate of 4000 infections (range: 1000–9700) by 18 January 2020  Nishiura et al  calculated 5502 (range: 3027–9057) infections by 24 January 2020 [18]  To better assess the epidemic risk of 2019-nCoV  among the key parameters to be approximated are the basic reproduction number R0 and the incubation period  We summarize previous efforts made toward those ends in Table 1  and present a short summary below  The majority of the estimates for R0 range between 2 and 3  Obtaining these was done by modeling epidemic trajectories and comparing them to the results of [16] as a baseline [19 20]  using a negative binomial distribution to generate secondary infections  Liu et al  utilized the exponential growth and maximum likelihood estimation methods and found that the 2019-nCoV may have a higher pandemic risk than SARS-CoV in 2003 [21]  Read et al  based their estimates on data from Wuhan exclusively (available up to 22 January 2020) and a deterministic SEIR model [22]  The choice of this date is motivated by the actions of authorities  that is the substantial travel limitations the next day  Li et al  used solely the patient data with illness onset between 10 December 2019 and 4 January 2020 [24]  The Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine have analyzed 2019-nCoV using SEIR and multiple data series [25]  Shen et al  used a SEIJR model (where J denotes the compartment of diagnosed and isolated individuals) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations [26] similarly to [27]  An alternative approach was presented by Majumder and Mandl [23] as they obtained their estimate based on the cumulative epidemic curve and the incidence decay and exponential adjustment (IDEA) model [31]  The incubation period was estimated to be in between 4 6 and 5 8 days by various studies  The first calculations used data up to 23 January [21]  Weibull distribution was identified as the best-fit model by several researches when comparing LogNormal  Gamma  and Weibull fits  Backer et al  used newly available patient data with known travel history and identified the Weibull distribution as the one with the best LOO (Leave-One-Out) score [28]  Linton et al  gave estimates for with and without Wuhan residents using their statistical model with  again  the Weibull distribution scoring the best AIC (Akaike information criterion) [29]  The Johns Hopkins University Infectious Disease Dynamics Group has been collecting substantial data on exposure and symptom onset for 2019-nCoV cases  They recommend using their LogNormal estimate [30]  which gives a 5 1 day incubation period  In this study we combine case estimates  epidemiological characteristics of the disease  international mobility patterns  control efforts  and secondary case distributions to assess the risks of major outbreaks from imported cases outside China  2  Materials and Methods 2 1  Model Ingredients Our method has three main components: (i) We estimate the cumulative number of cases in China outside Hubei province after 23 January  using a time-dependent compartmental model of the transmission dynamics (ii) We use that number as an input to the global transportation network to generate probability distributions of the number of infected travellers arriving at destinations outside China  (iii) In a destination country  we use a Galton–Watson branching process to model the initial spread of the virus  We calculate the extinction probability of each branch initiated by a single imported case  obtaining the probability of a major outbreak as the probability that at least one branch will not go extinct  2 2  Epidemic Size in China Outside the Closed Areas of Hubei The starting point of our transmission model is 23 January  when major cities in Hubei province were closed [7]  From this point forward  we run a time dependent SEn ImR model in China outside Hubei  which was calibrated to be consistent with the estimated case numbers outside Hubei until 31 January  We impose time dependence in the transmission parameter due to the control measures progressively implemented by Chinese authorities on and after 23 January  With our baseline R0 = 2 6  disease control is achieved when more than 61 5% of potential transmissions are prevented  We introduce a key parameter t_ to denote the future time when control measures reach their full potential  For this study we assume it to be in the range of 20–50 days after 23 January  Using our transmission model  we calculate the total cumulative number of cases (epidemic final size) outside Hubei  for each t_ in the given range  This also gives an upper bound for the increasing cumulative number of cases C = C(t)  2 3  Connectivity and Case Exportation The output C of the transmission model is used as the pool of potential travellers to abroad  and fed into the online platform EpiRisk [32]  This way  we evaluated the probability that a single infected individual is traveling from the index areas (in our case Chinese provinces other than Hubei) to a specific destination  Using a ten day interval for potential travel after exposure (just as in [15])  one can find from EpiRisk that in the January–February periods  assuming usual travel volumes  there is a 1/554 probability that a single case will travel abroad and cause an exported case outside China  The dataset for relative importation risks of countries is available as well  thus  one can obtain the probability of an exported case appearing in a specific country  This probability is denoted by q0  and we call it the baseline connectivity of that country with China  The baseline connectivity can be affected by other factors  such as the reduction in travel volume between the index and destination areas  exit screening in China  and the efficacy of entry screening at the destination country  Hence  we have a compound parameter  the actual connectivity q  which expresses the probability that a case in China outside Hubei will be eventually mixed into the population of the destination country  For example  the relative risk of Japan is 0 13343  meaning that 13 343% of all exportations are expected to appear in Japan  Thus  under normal circumstances  the probability that a case from China eventually ends up in Japan is 0 13343/554 = 2 41 _ 10􀀀4 during the January–February period [32]  Assuming a 20% reduction in travel volume between China and Japan  this baseline connectivity is reduced to a connectivity 0 8 _ 2 41 _ 10􀀀4 = 1 928 _ 10􀀀4  Additionally  assuming a 40% efficacy on entry screening [33]  there is a 0 6 probability that an arriving case passes the screening  and the connectivity parameter is further reduced to 0 6 _ 1 928 _ 10􀀀4 = 1 16 _ 10􀀀4  If we assume interventions at the originating area  for example  exit screening with 25% efficacy  then our actual connectivity parameter is q = 0 75 _ 1 16 _ 10􀀀4 = 8 7 _ 10􀀀5  which represents the probability that a case in China will eventually mix into the population in Japan  Assuming independence  this q  together with the cumulative cases C  generates a binomial distribution of importations that enter the population of a given country  2 4  Probability of a Major Outbreak in a Country by Imported Cases Each imported case that passes the entry screening and mixes into the local population can potentially start an outbreak  which we model by a Galton–Watson branching process with negative binomial offspring distribution with dispersion parameter k = 0 64 [19 20] and expectation Rloc  where Rloc is the local reproduction number of the infection in a given country  Each branch has extinction probability z  which is the unique solution of the equation z = g(z) on the interval (0  1)  where g is the generating function of the offspring distribution (see [34])  The process dies out if all the branches die out  thus  we estimate the risk of a major local outbreak from importation as 1 􀀀 zi  where i cases were imported  2 5  Dependence of the Risk of Major Outbreaks on Key Parameters The number of imported cases i is given by a random variable X  where X _ Binom(C  q)  The outbreak risk in a country x is then estimated as Riskx = E[1 􀀀 zX]  where E is the expectation of the outbreak probabilities  thus  we consider a probability distribution of branching processes  This way Riskx = Risk(C  q  Rloc)  which means that the risk depends on the efficacy of Chinese control measures that influence the cumulative case number C  the connectivity between the index and destination areas q  and the local reproduction number Rloc  The main question we aim to get insight into is how this risk depends on these three determining factors  The technical details of the modeling and calculations can be found in Appendices A  B  and C  3 1  Epidemic Size in China After calibration of the SE2 I3R model  we numerically calculated the final epidemic size (total cumulative number of cases) in China outside Hubei  using three different basic reproduction numbers and different control functions  The control functions were parametrized by t_  which is the time after 23 January at which the control reaches its maximal value umax  Smaller t_ corresponds to more rapid implementation of the control measures  In Figure 1  we plotted these cumulative numbers versus t_  and we can observe that the epidemic final size is rather sensitive to the speed of implementation of the control measures  These curves also give upper bounds for the number of cumulative cases at any given time  assuming that the control efforts will be successful  3 2  Risk of Major Outbreaks We generated a number of plots to depict Risk(C  q  Rloc) for selected groups of countries from
America  Europe  and Asia  In the left of Figure 2  we can see the risks of American countries as functions of cumulative number of cases C  assuming each country has Rloc = 1 6 and their connectivity is their baseline q  When C exceeds 600 000  with this local reproduction number and without any restriction in importation  outbreaks in the USA and Canada are very likely  while countries in South America (including Mexico)  which are all in the green shaded region  still have moderate risks  To illustrate the impacts of control measures for the USA and Canada  we reduced Rloc to 1 4  and plotted the risks for different levels of reduction in connectivity to China  either due to travel restrictions or entry screening  see Figure 2 on the right  As the number of cases in China approaches one million  such reductions have a limited effect on the risk of outbreak  Figure 1 provides us with scenarios when C remains below certain values  We considered the group of countries from Asia which are the most connected to China: Thailand  Japan  Taiwan  and the Republic of Korea  They have similar baseline connectivity q  and we focus on how travel restrictions and entry screenings can potentially reduce their risks  assuming different values of Rloc in the case C = 150 000 (on the left of Figure 3) and C = 600 000 (on the right of Figure 3)  For illustration purposes  we plotted Thailand (red) and the Republic of Korea (blue)  but Taiwan and
Japan are always between those two curves  We can see that  for example  on the right of Figure 3 for C = 600 000  unless Rloc is very small  considerable reduction of the outbreak risk can be achieved only by extreme measures that prevent most importations  In Figure 4  we assumed that European countries have very similar Rloc and looked at their risks as a function of the number of cases  For illustration purposes  we selected countries which have relatively high (UK  Germany  France  Italy)  medium (Belgium  Poland  Hungary)  and low (Bulgaria  Croatia  Lithuania) connectivity to China  On the left  we assumed Rloc = 1 4 and baseline q  and with these parameters  outbreaks will likely occur in high risk countries as the case number approaches one million  By reducing Rloc to 1 1 and by reducing q to the half of its baseline (meaning that we assume that there is a 50% reduction in importations due to decreased travel and entry screenings)  then the risk is significantly reduced  even with one million cases  3 3  Profile of Countries Benefiting the Most From Interventions We also plotted the risks on a two-parameter map  as functions of q and Rloc  Observing the gradients of the risk map  we can conclude that countries with low connectivity but high Rloc should focus on further reducing importations by entry screening and travel restrictions  while countries with high connectivity but smaller Rloc better focus on control measures that potentially further reduce Rloc  Countries in the middle benefit most from the combination of those two types of measures  4  Discussion By combining three different modelling approaches  we created a tool to assess the risk of 2019-nCoV outbreaks in countries outside of China  This risk depends on three key parameters: the cumulative number of cases in areas of China which are not closed  the connectivity between China and the destination country  and the local transmission potential of the virus  Quantifications of the outbreak risks and their dependencies on the key parameters were illustrated for selected groups of countries from America  Asia  and Europe  representing a variety of country profiles  There are several limitations of our model  as each ingredient uses assumptions  which are detailed in the Appendices  There are great uncertainties in the epidemiological parameters as well  It is difficult to predict the epidemic trajectory in China  as the effects of the control measures are not clear yet  There were recent disruptions in international travel  suggesting that the EpiRisk parameters will not be accurate in the future  Nevertheless  when we have new information in the future about the case numbers in China  travel frequencies  efficacy of entry screenings  and local control measures  our method will still be useful for assessing outbreak risks  We found that in countries with low connectivity to China but with relatively high Rloc  the most beneficial control measure to reduce the risk of outbreaks is a further reduction in their importation number either by entry screening or travel restrictions (see Figure 5)  Countries with high connectivity but low Rloc benefit the most from policies that further reduce Rloc  Countries in the middle should consider a combination of such policies  Different control measures affect different key parameters  Several of these measures have been readily implemented in China  aiming to prevent transmissions  These are incorporated into our transmission model influencing the cumulative number of cases C  The connectivity q may be affected  for example  by exit screening at Chinese airports  entry screening at the destination airport  and a decline in travel volume  all of which decrease the probability that a case from China will enter the population of the destination country  The parameter Rloc is determined by the characteristics and the control measures of the destination country  As new measures are implemented  or there is a change in travel patterns  these parameters may change in time as well  Cumulative cases and connectivity can be estimated  in general  However  to make a good assessment of the outbreak risk  it is very important to estimate Rloc in each country  In the absence of available transmission data  one may rely on the experiences from previous outbreaks  such as the detailed description in [35] of the reductions in the effective reproduction numbers for SARS due to various control measures  In this study  we used a range of Rloc values between the critical value 1 and the baseline R0 = 2 6  A further source of uncertainty is in the distribution of the generation time interval  since a different distribution gives a different outbreak risk even with the same Rloc  For our calculations  we used the distribution from [19] (see also [20])  a more in-depth discussion of this topic may be found in [36]  Knowing Rloc and the generation interval are needed not only to have a better quantitative risk estimation  but also for guidance as to which types of control measures may reduce the outbreak risk the most effectively  Appendix A  Transmission Dynamics The governing system of the transmission dynamics model is This is an extension of a standard SEIR model assuming gamma-distributed incubation and infectious periods  with the Erlang parameters n = 2 m = 3 (following the SARS-study [37])  Note that the choice of n = 2 is also consistent with the estimates summarized in Table 1  Given that disease fatalities do not have significant effect on the total population  we ignored them in the transmission model to ease the calculations (i e   m = 0 was used)  In this model  the basic reproduction number is R0 = b/g  the incubation period is a􀀀1 and the infectious period is g􀀀1  The model is used to describe the disease dynamics in China outside Hubei province after 23 January  We assume that at time t after 23 January  an increasing control function u(t) represents the fraction of the transmissions that are prevented  thus the effective reproduction number becomes R(t) = (1 􀀀 u(t))R0S(t)/N  Based on the previous estimates from the literature (see Table 1)  we chose an incubation period
a􀀀1 = 5 1 days [30]  basic reproduction number R0 = 2 6 (2 1–3 1) with the corresponding infectious period g􀀀1 = 3 3 (1 7–5 6) days [19]  To predict the final number of cases outside Hubei  we assume a gradually increasing control u from zero until a saturation point  and define t_ the time when the eventual control umax is achieved  The sooner this happens  the more successful the control is  Using the control term u(t) = minfumaxt/t_  umaxg  disease control is reached at t = t_(1 􀀀 1/R0)/umax  For the calculations we choose umax = 0 8  noting that such a drop in transmission has been observed for SARS  where the reproduction number was largely reduced by subsequent interventions [35]  With our baseline R0 = 2 6  disease control R(t) < 1 is achieved when u(t) > 0 615  meaning that more than 61 5% of potential transmissions are prevented  which occurs at time t = 0 77t_  Since the first case outside Hubei was reported on 19 January [5]  for the initialization of the model we could assume that number of infected individuals on 23 January outside Hubei was equal to the number of cumulative cases outside Hubei up to that day  To calibrate the model  we estimated the number of cases from 24 January till 31 January outside Hubei based on case exportations  using the methodology of [15]  assuming that exportations after 24 January were only from outside Hubei  Based on the maximal likelihood of case numbers that produce the observed number of exportations using EpiRisk [32]  we estimate that the reported confirmed cases represent only 6 3% of the total cases for the regions outside Hubei (other estimates for ascertainment rate were: 5 1% [22]  10% in [38]  and 9 2% (95% confidence interval: 5 0  20 0) [39])  see the inset in Figure 1  The initial values for the exposed compartments in the SEIR model were selected such that the model output was consistent with the estimated case numbers outside Hubei between 24 January and 31 January  Solving the compartmental model  we obtained final epidemic sizes for various reproduction numbers and control efforts (see Figure 1)  providing upper bounds for the cumulative number of cases C outside Hubei  Appendix B  Calculating the Risk of Outbreaks by Importation We create a probabilistic model to estimate the risk of a major outbreak in a destination country as a function of the cumulative number of cases C in China outside the closed areas  the local reproduction number Rloc in the destination country  and the connectivity q between China and the destination country  We summarize these in Table A1  We assume that the number of the imported cases entering the local population of the destination country follows a binomial distribution  i e   the probability pi corresponding to i imported cases in the destination country with connectivity q to China is given by We calculate the extinction probability z of a branching process initiated by a new infection in the destination country  As in [19 20]  we assume the number of secondary infections to follow a negative binomial distribution with generator function  We assume that the number of the imported cases entering the local population of the destination country follows a binomial distribution  i e   the probability pi corresponding to i imported cases in the destination country with connectivity q to China is given by pi =_Ci_qi(1 􀀀 q)C􀀀i  We calculate the extinction probability z of a branching process initiated by a new infection in the destination country  As in [19 20]  we assume the number of secondary infections to follow a negative binomial distribution with generator function g(z) = _ q 1 􀀀 (1 􀀀 q)z _k   with dispersion parameter k and mean m = Rloc  Then  the probability parameter q of the distribution is obtained as q = k k+Rloc   The extinction probability of a branch is the solution of the fixed point equation z = g(z)  Assuming that the destination country has I imported cases from China that are mixed into the local population  we estimate the probability of a major outbreak as the probability that not all the branches started by those i individuals die out  which is 1 􀀀 zi  Thus  the expectation of the risk of a major outbreak in country x can be calculated as Riskx = Cå i=0 pi(1 􀀀 zi) = 1 􀀀 (qz + 1 􀀀 q)C  where we used the binomial theorem to simplify the sum  Having the input values of the parameters C  q  Rloc  with this model we can numerically calculate the risk  Appendix C  The codes for the computations were implemented in Mathematica and in Python  and they are available  including the used data  at [40] ";Boldog  Péter  Tekeli  Tamás  Vizi  Zsolt  Dénes  Attila  Bartha  Ferenc A   Röst Gergely;Risk Assessment of Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 Outbreaks Outside China;"Journal of

week2_forecasting;https://doi org/10 1016/j idm 2020 03 002;Based on the official data modeling  this paper studies the transmission process of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)  The error between the model and the official data curve is quite small  At the same time  it realized forward prediction and backward inference of the epidemic situation  and the relevant analysis help relevant countries to make decisions ;"At the end of 2019  the new coronavirus (COVID-19) spread widely in China  and a large number of people became infected  At present  the domestic outbreak has been effectively controlled  while the new coronavirus is spreading rapidly in other areas  Currently  Europe has become the center of the current outbreak of new pneumonia  Meanwhile  on March 11  the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a new pneumonia outbreak a ""global pandemic "" The new coronavirus has caused a great threat to the health and safety of people all over the world due to its amazing spreading power and potential harm  The research on the domestic and international epidemics and the future development trend has become a hot topic of current research  At present  many teams have studied the transmission law and preventive measures of the COVID-19 (Corman et al   2020  Hui et al   2020  Rothe et al   2020)  and many meaningful results have been obtained (Mizumoto & Chowell  2020  Riou & Althaus  2020  Shao & Wu  2020)  According to the transmission characteristics of epidemic at different stages  this paper uses Gaussian distribution theory to construct a new model of coronavirus transmission  By simulating the propagation process of the COVID-19  we found that the curves of proposed model well simulate the official data curves of Hubei  Non-Hubei area of China and also South Korea  Italy  and Iran  The study points out the key factors that affect the spread of the virus  such as the basic reproduction number  virus incubation period  and daily infection number  At the same time  we predict the development trend of epidemics in different regions and infer the time of the initial cases  Furthermore  we analyzed the impact of different control times on the spread of the epidemic  Relevant models and data analysis can provide some basis and guidance for the related countries about epidemic prevention and control  The main contributions of this paper can answer the following 11 questions and be summarized as: ✓ Epidemic situation in Hubei Province of China: 1)  When will more than 10 000 confirmed coronavirus cases be completely cured in Hubei ? The model predicts that almost all cases will be cured before April 1 (Fig  1)  2)  When was the earliest case in Hubei? We find that there was already infections on November 24 (Fig  2)  3)  How many people are infected per person (Basic reproduction number)? It is 3 8 when not under control  0 5 after closing Wuhan city and 0 1 after closing of Wuhan community (Fig  3)  4)  What is the average incubation period of the virus? 6 days (Fig  4)  5)  If it is controlled 5 days in advance  how much is the infection? What if control is lagging 5 days? If 5 days in advance  the number of infected people will be 28 000  42% of the current number of confirmed cases  If the control is delayed for 5 days  it will reach 156 000 people  2 26 times of the current level  (68 000 in Hubei at March 13) (Fig  5)  6)  What distribution does the daily infection curve satisfy  which day reaches the peak  is February 12? The distribution satisfy Normal distribution  the actual peak appeared on February 8  In the official data  because the clinical diagnosis was not added before the February 12  the data surged on the February 12 (jump to 14 840 people  cumulative results)  indicating that the previously published data did not reflect the actual infection situation in Hubei (Fig  6)  7)  The average number of days from diagnosis to cure? In the stage of Hubei epidemic  it takes an average of 21 days for patients from diagnosis to cure (Fig  1)  ✓ Epidemic situation in non-Hubei areas of China: 8)  What is the law of transmission in non-Hubei areas? The epidemic transmission curve of non-Hubei area is similar to that of Hubei area  which was controlled 10 days in advance (on January 13)  (Fig  7)  ✓ International epidemic situation except China 9)  How to predict the epidemic situation in South Korea? At present  the epidemic situation in South Korea is basically under control  According to the model  South Korea will be basically under control by the end of March  It was found on January 7 that there was infection in South Korea (confirmed by official broadcast January 20  In addition  we found that the basic reproduction number before the control was 4 2 in Korea and 0 1 after the control (Fig  8)  In March 13  15 000 people in Italy are infected  If not controlled  it will increase dramatically  It will reach 250 000 by the end of March  In fact  Italy began to control on March 8  According to China’s basic reproduction number 0 5 (when city is closed)  it will reach 100 000 by the end of March  The basic reproduction number in Italy is 3 8 before control  According to the model inversion  the infection was found on January 10 in Italy (2 cases were confirmed by the official broadcast January 31)  (Fig  9)  In March 13  11 000 people are infected in Iran  Our model predicts that it will reach 33 000 people at the end of March  through backward inference of the epidemic situation  we found that Iran had an infection on January 11 (officially reporting that two cases died on February 20  and there was no official data before)  The model found that the basic reproduction number in Iran before the control was 3 8 (Fig  10)  2  Specific analysis of the epidemic situation model The epidemic data of Hubei Province is large (http://wjw hubei gov cn/)  more in line with the statistical law  and the statistical model is more able to reflect the process of virus transmission  so we build a statistical model for the epidemic situation of Hubei Province (see the method section later for details)  Based on the data provided by National Health Commission of China (NHCC)  we have carried out accurate simulation  By comparing the simulation results with the real data  we analyze the propagation process and its influencing factors  2 1  Simulation comparison of epidemic model in Hubei Province According to the comparison between the official epidemic data and simulation data of Hubei Province (see Fig  1 for details)  we can see that the model simulation curve of the number of confirmed infections  the number of cured people and the number of dead people matches the official data curve very well  According to the curve of simulated number of infected persons and the curve of official number of infected persons  we can see that there is a certain gap between the number of infected persons before February 12  and the others are basically the same  (after the official announced the method of clinical diagnosis of pneumonia on February 12  the data on that day surged to 14 000  indicating that the official data had some omissions before February 12  and our model give a more accurate response to the number of actual cases)   2 2  Simulation of the number of infected people According to the curve of simulated infection number  we infer that by the end of March (yellow line þ light blue line ¼ dark blue line: Number of simulated cures þ Number of simulated deaths ¼ Number of simulated infections)  all cases will be basically treated  that is to say  more than 10 000 cases in Hubei will be basically cured and cleared  Note: the number of cases of infection on December 24 is not zero  Because the data in Fig  1 is too large  small data cannot be displayed  For this reason  according to the same distribution curve  we also give the simulation data results before December 24  and the simulation found that the initial infected people had existed as early as November 24 (see Fig  2 for details)  The first confirmed infection was reported on December 8 (http://www stdaily com/)  2 3  Simulation of the number of the average infected people The basic regeneration number has a great influence on the spread of the outbreak  As the number of basic regeneration increases  the total number of people infected will also increase  and the greater the number of basic regeneration  the faster the disease will spread  As in the previous simulation  there are three phases  The first phase is an uncontrolled phase  Through a large number of simulations  we found that the basic regeneration number is 3 8  and the second and third phases are controlled phases  The basic regeneration numbers are respectively It is 0 5 and 0 1 (see the yellow line in Fig  3)  The simulated curve (yellow line) can be closer to the official diagnosis curve (red line) in Hubei  The first stage is the free propagation stage  and we also give other simulation results of the basic regeneration number in the range of 3e4 6 (the second and third stages remain unchanged)  The effect of transmission is significant  with the most accurate final infections being obtained only at 3 8  As for the basic regeneration number in the stage of free propagation  some scholars have proposed that it should be between (2 8 3 9) or (3 6 7 4) (Read et al   2020)  Obviously  these expressions are either inaccurate or too wide  2 4  Simulation of the average latency Fig  4 shows the comparison chart of the average incubation period  We simulated the days in the range of 3e9 respectively  and found that when the average incubation period was set to 6 days  it could better fit the official curve  while the other simulated values are quite different from the official curves  It is also found that the shorter the incubation period  the faster the virus spreads and the greater the total number of infections  David mentioned that the incubation period of the virus is 3e6 days  which is not accurate  According to the previous analysis  the disease develops on average after 6 days of incubation  and it takes an average of 5 days from the morbidity to the diagnosis (data from CHCC) (http://www labour-daily cn)  that is  5 þ 6 ¼ 11 days from the initial infection and incubation to the diagnosis and isolation after the morbidity  Obviously  not all 11 days are contagious  Simulations show that when the average time for contagion is set to 8 days  it fits the official curve best  2 5  The simulation test of the epidemic control We know that epidemic control at different times (such as closing city) will have an important impact on the spread of the epidemic  obviously the earlier the better  Combined with the actual situation of Wuhan’s closure from January 23  we simulated the comparison of the spread of the epidemic situation on January 18 and January 28  as shown in Fig  5  The red curve and the orange curve in the figure respectively represent the official curve and the simulation curve (when the ""cities were closed"" measures were taken on January 23)  Obviously  the two curves match well  and the simulated final number of infected people is 69 000  which is also close to the actual situation  If the control is started five days in advance  that is  on January 18  the blue line shows that the number of infected people is about 28 000  which is 0 42 times of the number of confirmed cases  If the measures are delayed for 5 days  it can be seen from the yellow line that the number of people will be as high as 156 000  about 2 26 times of the current number of patients  Zhong Nanshan’s team once predicted that if the closure measures were delayed for five days  the number of patients would reach three times of the current number  i e  210000 (Heymann  2020)  Our results are more optimistic  It can be seen from this figure that it is necessary to take timely measures to control the spread of the epidemic  which can also be used as a reference for some overseas countries  2 6  The simulation of daily new infections We also studied the curve of the daily increase in the number of people (Fig  6)  Because the official did not include the imaging features of pneumonia in the clinical diagnosis into the diagnosis conditions for statistics before February 12  2020  the omission and inaccuracy of the previous data caused the official data to jump on the February 12 (the number of newly diagnosed patients in Hubei was 14 840 people)  As shown in Fig  6  our simulation data meet the normal distribution  at this time  the daily new infection data peaked on February 8  with the number of 4500  However  the published data  due to not timely included in the clinical diagnosis image test (red line)  many patients were not diagnosed  but the curve has become a downward trend  data deviation  For this reason  we smoothed the clinical diagnosis data on February 12  13 and 14  and used the Gauss function of latent period  These three days were chosen because of the sudden increase of the number of clinical diagnosis in these three days  It can be seen from the figure that the smooth number of official daily infected persons (black line) and the simulation curve (blue line) fit very well  3  Data analysis of non-Hubei regions Due to the large liquidity before the Spring Festival in China  Hubei Province has produced case output  We have also conducted research on non-Hubei area  which is also divided into three stages: the first stage is before January 26 (30 provinces and cities in the country enter the first level of combat readiness on January 26)  the second stage is from January 26 to February 5 (the whole country starts to close the community in early February  here we take No  5 for simulation)  the third stage is after February 5  A large number of simulations found that the regeneration numbers in the three stages were 3 8  0 5  and 0 1  respectively  At this time  the simulation curve (blue line) and the actual curve (red line) fit well  Another interesting phenomenon is that we found that if Hubei ’s transmission was controlled 10 days in advance (Hubei began to control on January 13)  its propagation curve (yellow line) is highly similar to the propagation curve in non-Hubei regions  On January 24th  235 cases were confirmed in non-Hubei province  with an accumulation of 1052 cases in Hubei province  accounting for about 20%  Finally  it was officially announced that non-Hubei 13 220 and Hubei 67 786 were infected  which was also basically in line with the proportion of 20%  In otherwords  there is a high degree of similarity between the initial and final transmission ratios in Hubei and non-Hubei areas  4  The prediction of foreign epidemic 4 1  Analysis of Korea data From March 2  South Korea began to implement large-scale measures to prevent and control the epidemic situation (https://www best73 com)  At present  the epidemic situation in South Korea is basically under control  Our model simulates the actual data well  and it is found through model prediction (Fig  8)  That South Korea will be basically controlled by the end of March We inferred from the curve and found that therewas an infection in South Korea on January 7 (the official broadcast confirmed the diagnosis at January 20)  We found that before the control  the basic reproduction number of virus transmission in Korea was 4 2  and the basic reproduction number after control was 0 1  (The basic reproduction number reached 4 2  We suspect that some churches in South Korea ignored the spread of the epidemic in the early stage ) 4 2  Analysis of Italian data In March 13  15 000 people are infected in Italy  Through simulation  we find that (Fig  9)  if we do not control (blue line) at all  it will grow explosively  reaching 250 000 at the end of March  In fact  Italy began to control population flow on March 8  According to the basic reproduction number (0 5) after China’s city control  our model predicts that by the end of March  the number of confirmed cases in Italy will reach 100 000 (yellow line)  At present  the basic reproduction number in Italy is 3 8  According to the model inversion  therewere infected persons in Italy on January 10 (2 cases were confirmed in Italian official broadcast January 29 (https://tech sina com cn/))  (The reproduction number reaches 3 8  which is similar to the date of the early stage in china ) 4 3  Analysis of Iranian data In March 13  11 000 people are infected in Iran  According to the simulation  as shown in Fig  10  the infection data is expected to reach 33 000 by the end of March  and then it will be basically controlled by the beginning of April  It was found that Iran had infection on January 11 (Officially announced 2 cases died on February 20  no previous official data) (https://www huxiu com/)  The model found that the basic reproduction number of virus transmission in Iran before control was 3 8  and the basic reproduction number after control was 1  (the Iranian government took many control measures in early March  The basic reproduction number after control is 1  indicating that the control effect is not ideal ) 5  Model and description 5 1  Transmission of the virus Many studies have shown that virological transmission usually satisfies the Gaussian distribution  so this article uses the Gaussian distribution to analyze the transmission of viruses (Yang and Niu  2018  2019)  Whenwe use Gaussian distribution to simulate  the main influence is the average value  but the standard deviation has little influence  so we will take the best accord with the objective fact variance to simulate  The basic reproduction number is the number of people infected by a patient during the average illness period when all are susceptible at the morbidity of the disease  The Gaussian distribution function of D1 e Nðx1  y1Þ is used to represent the propagation ability of the virus  This formula indicates that a single infected person can infect  1 person on average in the first stage  At this stage   1 has a value range of ð1  þ ∞Þ  and a standard deviation of y1 ¼ 1:5  With the development of a series of effective measures  the daily increase of the number of infected people also decreased to a certain extent  and the transmission ability of the disease in the population decreased  For the ability to spread disease through this process  we still use the Gaussian distribution  When a single infected person at this stage is able to infect an average of  2 individuals  the formula for the capacity to transmit is  D2 e Nðx2 y2Þ  At this stage  the value range of  2 is general ð0  1   standard deviation of  2 is y2 ¼ 2*x2  Because the medical condition of affected area and the degree of people’s activity intention directly decide the basic regeneration number in this stage  The better the health care  the less active the population  the smaller the  2  In the course of disease transmission  the patient from being infected to the morbidity of disease  we call it incubation period  We assume that it takes  3 days for people to get infected and become aware of the disease  then the incubation period follows D3eNðx3 y3Þ  In this model x3 ¼ 6:0  the standard deviation y3 ¼ 2:0  In addition  patients can transmit the virus to other people  so we assume that the average time from infection to transmission is  4 days  which follows D4eNðx4 y4Þ  According to the previous analysis  the disease develops after an average of six days of incubation  and it takes an average of five days from morbidity to diagnosis (according to NHCC)  that is  5 þ 6 ¼ 11 days from the initial incubation of infection to post-morbidity isolation  Clearly  not all 11 days are infectious  and simulations show that setting the average number of infectious days to 8 best fits the official curve  In this model x4 ¼ 8:0  the standard deviation y4 ¼ 1:5  5 2  Cure the discharge process The cure time of the patient is the difference between the time of hospital discharge and the time of diagnosis  set to  5  During the epidemic period  the cure time of patients was expressed by Gaussian distribution  that is  D5eNðx5  y5Þ  which means that it takes an average of  5 days for a single individual to be cured and discharged from hospital  During the early and late stages of the epidemic  depending on the medical condition and level of vigilance  there will be small changes to the  5  As the epidemic continued  people’s awareness of self-protection became stronger  and hospital treatment became more effective in the late stage of the outbreak  the patient’s recovery time became shorter and shorter  In Hubei Province  the average time from diagnosis to cure was 21 days  5 3  Death toll Relative to the spread of previous diseases  the early mortality rate of this disease is also very high  mainly due to the lack of understanding of the new virus  and secondly  the new crown virus transmission is very strong  leading to the collapse of the medical system in the epidemic area  Due to the continuous improvement of medical conditions and other reasons  the mortality rate of the disease has continued to ease  We assume that the mortality rate is  6  then the mortality distribution follows D6eNðx6  y6Þ  The mortality rate will change in stages depending on medical conditions  According to the CHCC  Hubei Province’s current mortality rate is 4 5 percent  6  Conclusion In this paper  through analyzing the existing data of Hubei epidemic situation  the corresponding model is established  and then the simulation is carried out  Here  we studied the main factors affecting the spread of COVID-19  such as the number of basic regenerations  the incubation period and the average number of days of cure  What’s more  we predicted the evolution trend of the existing epidemic data  and found that imposing controls would have important impact on the epidemic  In addition  according to the existing data abroad  we also make bold predictions of the epidemic development trends in South Korea  Italy  and Iran  pointing out the possible outbreaks and the corresponding control time  and tracing the earliest transmission dates of countries  Finally  we hope that this article can make some contributions to the world’s response to this epidemic and give some references for future research  Appendix A  Methods A1  Data We obtained the data from the NHC of China  2020  The data information includes the cumulative confirmed cases  the cumulative number of deaths  newly confirmed cases and the cumulative number of cured cases for Hubei and non-Hubei provinces from January 26 to March 10  We also used the data on the recent diagnoses in South Korea  Iran  and Italy  it includes the data from the January 20 (the first confirmed diagnosis) to March 13 (the epidemic stabilized) in South Korea  the data from the January 31 (the first confirmed case) to March 20 in Italy and the data from the February 20 (the first confirmed case) to March 20 in Iran  and here  the data comes from official notifications from various countries  A2  Parameter estimation process In different control stages  the Basic reproduction number changes greatly and it affects the intensity of control directly  In addition  the incubation period of the virus affects the speed of transmission directly  These two parameters need to be estimated  Current literature shows that the uncontrolled Basic reproduction number fluctuates between [2 8  7 4] (Read et al   2020)  Therefore  we chose the valuation range in the corresponding range  For the controlled Basic reproduction number  the range of valuationwas selected in the range of [0  1 5]  At the same time  due to the incubation period of NHCC is given in 3e7 days  so we put the estimates of the incubation period interval in the 3e9 days  The average time for contagion of individuals is also an important parameter  In this paper  according to the data of NHCC  we knowthat it takes 5 days from the onset to the diagnosis of isolation  and the first three days of the onset are infectious (Xia et al   2020)  so the average time for contagion in this paper is 3 þ 5 ¼ 8  The Monte Carlo method was used in the building stage of the model  and we used the programming language-Cþþ for modeling  In this model  a single individual may be in the following four states  latency  illness  health  or death  According to the different control stages of the specific regions  (such as Hubei regions  non-Hubei regions in China  Italy  et al )  We set up different Gaussian distributions for propagation simulation  By selecting the optimal estimated parameters to fit the official curve  we use the Particle Swarm optimization algorithm to optimal the model  Then  we predict the future development trend based on the obtained parameter values  The infection time of the initial case was reversed by the model  The simulation results are shown in Figs  1e10  ";Li  Lixiang  Yang  Zihang  Dang

and hospital settings  where interpretation is often performed without expert radiologists  In addition  X-rays can be performed without increased risk of aerosolizing the pathogen  unlike laboratory tests that involve probing the patient's respiratory system  The X-rays may also enable the triage of patients into highest risk  high risk and lower risk of further complications  as well as to indicate the severity of disease at one or more time points  The focus of this preliminary paper is to determine whether chest X-rays may help with diagnosis of COVID-19 
There has been some other recent work on using chest X-rays for COVID-19 diagnosis that also indicate there may be some level of utility [?  ?  ?]  The results  while also on relatively small datasets  have good sensitivity to COVID-19  To see if chest X-rays may be viable as method for diagnosis  we worked with 122 chest X-rays of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and a set of 4273 chest X-rays of patients diagnosed with either viral pneumonia or bacterial pneumonia that predates the emergence of COVID-19  It is thought the other types of pneumonia would be most difficult to differentiate from COVID-19  Transfer learning using a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN) has been done to see if it may be possible to diagnose COVID-19 from CXR  An issue with our data is that the stage of disease is unknown for the COVID-19 group  only that they had abnormal chest X-rays  However  from our small data set it can be seen that it may be feasible to use CXR for diagnosis  especially if there are breathing issues  2 Data There were 122 COVID-19 cases obtained from 3 sources (A: https://github com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset (92 cases)  B: https://radiopaedia org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=covid&scope=all&lang=us (20 cases) and C: http://www sirm org/en/ (10 cases))  The 92 in A and the 10 available in B on March 23  2020 were used in training  The 4273 pneumonia cases come from https://www kaggle com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia and are from children under 5 years of age  which was not understood initially  To create a balanced training set  we randomly chose 102 other pneumonia cases to get 2/3 being viral pneumonia cases and 1/3 bacterial pneumonia cases  3 Experimental setup The VGG16 CNN [?  ?] which was trained on color camera images from Imagenet was used in doing transfer learning  VGG16 has 16 layers and we used the convolutional layers without change  As it has 3 channels for RGB  and X-rays are grayscale  the same image scaled to the size of 224x224 was provided to each channel  There are 13 convolutional layers  each uses a small filter of size 3x3 with 1 stride and padding of 1 to extract features  Five max pooling layers with a 2x2 window and stride of 2 are used after each block of the convolutional layers  In our model  the last layers of VGG16 were removed and replaced by the trainable part which consisted of global average pooling  followed by a fully connected layer of 64 units with dropout and finally a classification layer with sigmoid output  The cyclic learning rate (https://github com/bckenstler/CLR) was used with Base learning rate= 0 0001 and Max learning rate= 0 001  RMSprop was used for learning with binary-cross-entropy as the loss function  With this small data set  a 10-fold cross validation was done  The only augmentation
done was horizontal flipping  As we did not have enough data to set aside a validation set for parameter tuning or stopping  we chose to use a Snapshot ensemble [?] of 5 classifiers  When the training accuracy curve reached > 95% accuracy  training was done for 20 more epochs  We chose 5 models from the stored weights of models within those 20 epochs with a gap of 4 to create the snapshot ensemble  The outputs of the 5 models were averaged to determine the class  We also tried a small experiment on unseen data consisting of the later collected
COVID-19 data (20 cases) and the rest of the pneumonia cases (4171)  For this  we did the same type of transfer learning with VGG16 with a different data setup  Of the 102 images in each class  18 of each class were used in a validation set (36 images) and then horizontal flipping was done for augmentation of the rest which made up the training data  A Snapshot ensemble of 7 models was created as follows  When the validation accuracy was > 0:95  starting from that epoch  7 models were extracted for voting with a gap of 10 epochs between them  4 Results A 10-fold cross validation was done to get an estimate of the feasibility of using chest X-rays to diagnose COVID-19  The initial results  if they can be replicated on bigger more diverse data sets  show promise  The overall accuracy was 96 1% with 100% of the COVID cases correctly identified (sensitivity=1) and other pneumonia correctly identified 94/102 for specificity/true negative rate (TNR) TNR= 0 9215  Consequently  there were 8 false positives of other pneumonia  Our Overall AUC was 0 997  We had a number of unseen pneumonia cases (4171 cases) and acquired new COVID-19 cases (20 cases) not in training  With a Snapshot ensemble of 7 models created using all 204 images for training  all 20 unseen COVID-19 cases were correctly identified  The true negative rate was 95 75% so the false positives were lower in this case  The AUC was 0 995  5 Discussion and Conclusions There has been work on diagnosing COVID-19 from computed tomography (CT) scans [?] which showed promise and is discussed below  This work focuses on CXRs which are simpler to obtain  more widely available worldwide and cheaper to obtain  though provide less information that CT  Our current work has about a 5% false positive rate that may be reduced by biasing the training data to include more non COVID-19 cases and 100% true positive rate  Though one does not want to reduce the true positive rate  the ratio of examples could be modified to reduce the FPR  but would require experiments that are best facilitated by more CXR data  Given the existing chest CT's of COVID-19 that are available  the option to create pseudo chest X-rays from them is an  albeit unusual  option for adding to our data set of COVID-19 cases  A recent paper looked at 4 356 chest CT exams from 3 322 patients [?] with 1 296 (30%) exams for COVID-19  1 735 (40%) for pneumonia and 1 325 (30%) for non-pneumonia  So  a good sized data set from which they concluded that CT had diagnostic utility for COVID-19 diagnosis  An AUC=0 96 was obtained for COVID-ID identification  They used deep learning to extract a 3D view of the lungs and then a Resnet50 [?] based model to do the diagnosis  The results suggest CT can be useful for COVID-19 diagnosis  so maybe CXRs  despite the reduced information they contain  may also be useful  Several very recent papers have also shown results with just chest X-rays for COVID-19  In [?] 1 427 CXR images were used which consisted of 224 images with confirmed COVID-19  700 images with confirmed common pneumonia  and 504 images that were normal  They did transfer learning and looked at several models finding VGG19 to be the best  In a 10-fold cross validation they found true positives - TP=208  false negatives - FN=16  true negatives - TN=1189  false positives - FP=15  While it appears that some tuning may have been done in the cross validation making for slightly optimistic results  the results are positive  In [?] they developed a deep learning anomaly detection approach for screening from chest X-rays  Anomaly detection is a more challenging problem formulation  as it is one class classification  They did correctly classify 96% of 100 chest X-rays from 70 COVID-19 patients  On 1 431 CXR from 1 008 pneumonia patients they had 76 5% accuracy  So  they had quite a few more false positives than we did  yet still there is differentiation shown  In [?] transfer learning was done to identify CXRs as pneumonia or normal  They obtained 96% accuracy with a Resnet50 model on a data set of 4 273 pneumonia and 1 583 normal with 60% of the data used for training and 40% used for testing  This again suggests there is a possibility of effectively using deep learning on chest X-rays for disease detection  In [?] a Hong Kong study  it was shown chest X-ray abnormalities in COVID-19 match those seen in CT  and show bilateral peripheral consolidation  They looked at 64 CXR cases and did find a 69% sensitivity on a baseline scan  which was lower than the non-imaging test they applied (91%)  Our data set only includes patients with CXR findings  and as a result our algorithm is unable to detect disease in patients who do not have human-observable CXR findings on presentation (31% as suggested by the Hong Kong study)  A machine learning approach may be able to identify abnormalities in patients who have normal appearing CXR findings to a human interpreter  however  this hypothesis can only be explored after development of a dataset of CXRs from COVID-19 positive patients that also includes images that have been read as negative by an MD  Importantly  the Hong Kong study also suggests the possibility of using CXRs to identify COVID-
19 positive patients with false negative laboratory tests  a significant problem facing physicians with current estimates for nasopharyngeal swabs as high as 30%  and even higher for oropharyngeal swabs  In work on lung cancer screening from low dose CT images [?]  small data sets have been used to build effective ensembles of CNN's that can predict lung nodules that become malignant between 1 and 2 years after imaging with an AUC=0 94  Hence  a next step is to build CNN type models without transfer learning  It is also possible to create transfer learning ensembles and add those into the mix of classifiers whose results will be combined  This preliminary work with just 102 COVID-19 chest X-rays used in training indicates it may be possible to build deep neural network models for accurate diagnosis  In a 10-fold cross validation experiment with 102 cases of COVID-19 and 102 cases of other pneumonia  overall accuracy was 96 7% with all COVID-19 cases correctly identified  Using a model built from all training data on 20 unseen COVID-19 cases and 4 171 viral and bacterial pneumonia cases the true positive rate was 100% with a true negative rate of 95 75%  Among the many limitations of this work is the small number of cases available  the lack of information on what stage of disease the chest X-rays are from  the lack of information on outcomes  and the lack of information on the types of chest X-rays most likely to be confused  Nevertheless  the current
results indicate that a deep learned model applied to chest X-rays can be of some help in diagnosing COVID-19  The collection of more COVID-19 images is the most important task towards effectively answering the question of whether chest X-rays can be a truly useful tool for fast  accurate  relatively inexpensive diagnosis of the disease ";Hall Lawrence O   Paul  Rahul  Goldgof Dmitry B   Goldgof  Gregory M ;Finding COVID-19 from Chest X-rays using Deep Learning on a Small Dataset;TechRxiv;something
week2_phylogenetic_analysis;10 1038 nm1024;Three human coronaviruses are known to exist: human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E)  HCoV-OC43 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV)  Here we report the identification of a fourth human coronavirus  HCoVNL63  using a new method of virus discovery  The virus was isolated from a 7-month-old child suffering from bronchiolitis and conjunctivitis  The complete genome sequence indicates that this virus is not a recombinant  but rather a new group 1 coronavirus  The in vitro host cell range of HCoV-NL63 is notable because it replicates on tertiary monkey kidney cells and the monkey kidney LLC-MK2 cell line  The viral genome contains distinctive features  including a unique N-terminal fragment within the spike protein  Screening of clinical specimens from individuals suffering from respiratory illness identified seven additional HCoV-NL63-infected individuals  indicating that the virus was widely spread within the human population ;"To date  there is still a variety of human diseases with unknown etiology  A viral origin has been suggested for many of these diseases  emphasizing the importance of a continuous search for new viruses1–3  Major difficulties are encountered  however  when searching for new viruses  First  some viruses do not replicate in vitro  at least not in the cells that are commonly used in viral diagnostics  Second  for those viruses that do replicate in vitro and cause a cytopathic effect (CPE)  the subsequent virus identification methods may fail  Antibodies raised against known viruses may not recognize the cultured virus  and virus-specific PCR methods may not amplify the new viral genome  To solve both problems  we developed a new method for virus discovery based on the cDNAamplified restriction fragment–length polymorphism technique (cDNA-AFLP4)  Here we report the identification of a new coronavirus using this method of Virus-Discovery-cDNAAFLP (VIDISCA)  Coronaviruses  a genus of the Coronaviridae family  are enveloped viruses with a large plus-strand RNA genome  The genomic RNA is 27–32 kb in size  capped and polyadenylated  Three serologically distinct groups of coronaviruses have been described  Within each group  viruses are characterized by their host range and genome sequence  Coronaviruses have been identified in mice  rats  chickens  turkeys  swine  dogs  cats  rabbits  horses  cattle and humans  and can cause a variety of severe diseases including gastroenteritis and respiratory tract diseases5 6  Three human coronaviruses have been studied in detail  HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 were identified in the mid-1960s  and are known to cause the common cold7–15  The recently identified SARS-CoV causes a life-threatening pneumonia  and is the most pathogenic human coronavirus identified thus far16–18  SARS-CoV is likely to reside in an animal reservoir  and has recently initiated the epidemic in humans through zoonotic transmission19 20  It has been suggested that SARS-CoV is the first member of a fourth group of coronaviruses  or that it is an outlier of group 2 (refs  21  22)  The new coronavirus that we present here was isolated from a child suffering from bronchiolitis and conjunctivitis  This was not an isolated case  as we identified the virus in clinical specimens from seven additional individuals  both infants and adults  during the last winter season  We also resolved the complete sequence of the viral
genome  which revealed several unique features  RESULTS Virus isolation from a child with acute respiratory disease In January 2003  a 7-month-old child was admitted to the hospital with coryza  conjunctivitis and fever  Chest radiography revealed typical features of bronchiolitis  A nasopharyngeal aspirate specimen was collected 5 d after the onset of disease (sample NL63)  Diagnostic tests for respiratory syncytial virus  adenovirus  influenza viruses A and B  parainfluenza virus types 1  2 and 3  rhinovirus  enterovirus  HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 yielded negative results  The clinical sample was subsequently inoculated onto human fetal lung fibroblasts  tertiary monkey kidney cells (Cynomolgus monkey) and HeLa cells  CPE was detected exclusively on tertiary monkey kidney cells  and was first noted 8 d after inoculation  The CPE was diffuse  with a refractive appearance in the affected cells followed by cell detachment  More pronounced CPE was observed upon passage onto the monkey kidney cell line LLC-MK2  with overall cell rounding and moderate cell enlargement (Supplementary Fig  1 online)  Additional subcultures on human fetal lung fibroblasts  rhabdomyosarcoma cells and Vero cells remained negative for CPE  Immunofluorescence assays to detect respiratory syncytial virus  adenovirus  influenza viruses A and B  and parainfluenza virus types 1  2 and 3 remained negative  Acid lability and chloroform sensitivity tests indicated that the virus was most likely enveloped  and did not belong to the picornavirus group23  Virus discovery by the VIDISCA method Identification of unknown pathogens using molecular biology tools is difficult because the target sequence is not known  so genome-specific PCR primers cannot be designed  To overcome this problem  we developed the VIDISCA method based on the cDNA-AFLP technique4  The advantage of VIDISCA is that prior knowledge of the sequence is not required  as the presence of restriction enzyme sites is sufficient to guarantee PCR amplification  The input sample can be either blood plasma or serum  or culture supernatant  Whereas cDNA-AFLP starts with isolated mRNA  VIDISCA begins with a treatment to selectively enrich for viral nucleic acid  including a centrifugation step to remove residual cells and mitochondria (Fig  1a) A DNase treatment is also used to remove interfering chromosomal and mitochondrial DNA from degraded cells (viral nucleic acid is protected within the viral particle)  Finally  by choosing frequently cutting restriction enzymes  the method can be fine-tuned such that most viruses will be amplified  We were able to amplify viral nucleic acids in EDTA-treated plasma from a person with hepatitis B viral infection  and from a person with an acute parvovirus B19 infection (Fig  1b)  The technique can also detect HIV-1 in cell culture  demonstrating its capacity to identify both RNA and DNA viruses (Fig  1b)  The supernatant of the CPE-positive LLC-MK2 culture NL63 was analyzed by VIDISCA  The supernatant of uninfected cells was used as a negative control  After the second PCR amplification step  unique and prominent DNA fragments were present in the test sample but not in the control (1 of 16 selective PCR reactions is shown in Fig  1c)  These fragments were cloned and sequenced  Thirteen of 16 fragments showed sequence similarity to members of the coronavirus family  but significant sequence divergence with known coronaviruses was apparent in all fragments  indicating that we had identified a new coronavirus  The sequences of the 13 VIDISCA fragments are provided in Supplementary Figure 2 online  Detection of HCoV-NL63 in patient specimens To show that HCoV-NL63 originated from the nasopharyngeal aspirate of the child  we designed a diagnostic RT-PCR that specifically detects HCoV-NL63  This test confirmed the presence of HCoV-NL63 in the clinical sample  The sequence of the RT-PCR product of the 1b gene was identical to that of the virus identified upon in vitro passage in LLC-MK2 cells (data not shown)  Having confirmed that the cultured coronavirus originated from the child  the question remained as to whether this was an isolated clinical case  or whether HCoV-NL63 is circulating in humans  To address this question  we used two diagnostic RT-PCR assays to examine respiratory specimens of hospitalized individuals and those visiting the outpatient clinic between December 2002 and August 2003 (Fig  2)  We identified seven additional individuals carrying HCoV-NL63 (Table 1)  Sequence analysis of the PCR products indicated the presence of a few characteristic point mutations in several samples  suggesting that several viruses with different molecular markers may be cocirculating (Fig  3 and Supplementary Fig  3 online)  At least five of the HCoV-NL63-positive individuals suffered from respiratory tract illness  the clinical data of two individuals was not available  Including the index case  five of the patients were children less than 1 year old  and three patients were adults  Two adults were likely to be immunosuppressed  as one of them was a bone marrow transplant recipient and the other an HIV-positive patient suffering from AIDS  with very low CD4+ cell counts (Table 1)  No clinical data was available for the third adult  One patient was coinfected with respiratory syncytial virus (no  72)  and the HIV-infected patient (no  466) carried Pneumocystis carinii  No other respiratory agent was found in the other patients  suggesting that the respiratory symptoms were caused by HCoV-NL63  All positive samples were collected during the last winter season  with a detection frequency of 7% in January
2003  None of the 306 samples collected in the spring and summer of 2003 contained HCoV-NL63 (P < 0 01 by two-tailed t test)  Complete genome analysis of HCoV-NL63 The genomes of coronaviruses have a characteristic organization  The 5′two-thirds contain the 1a and 1b genes that encode the nonstructural polyproteins  followed by the genes encoding four structural proteins: spike (S)  envelope (E)  membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N)  The genomes of known coronaviruses contain a variable number of unique characteristic open reading frames (ORFs) encoding nonstructural proteins either between the 1b and S genes  between the S and E genes  between the M and N genes  or downstream of the N gene  To determine whether the HCoV-NL63 genome organization shares these characteristics we constructed a cDNA library with purified virus stock as input material  A total of 475 genome fragments were analyzed  with an average coverage of seven sequences per nucleotide  Specific PCR reactions were designed to fill in gaps and to sequence regions with low-quality sequence data We combined this with 5′and 3′rapid amplification of cDNA ends to resolve the complete HCoV-NL63 genome sequence  The RNA genome of HCoV-NL63 consists of 27 553 nucleotides
and a poly-A tail  With a GC content of 34%  HCoV-NL63 has the lowest GC content among the Coronaviridae  which range from 37–42% (ref  24)  ZCurve software was used to identify the ORFs25  and the genome configuration was portrayed using the similarity with known coronaviruses as a guide (Fig  4a and Supplementary Table 1 online)  Short untranslated regions (UTRs) of 286 and 287 nucleotides are present at the 5′and 3′termini  respectively  The 1a and 1b genes encode the RNA polymerase and proteases that are essential for virus replication  A potential pseudoknot structure is present at position 12 439 (data not shown)  which may provide the –1 frameshift signal to translate the 1b polyprotein  Genes predicted to encode the S  E  M and N proteins are found in the 3′part of the genome  The hemagglutinin-esterase gene  which is present in some group 2 coronaviruses  is not present in HCoV-NL63  ORF3  located between the S and E genes  probably encodes a single accessory nonstructural protein  this gene showed only limited similarity to ORF4A and ORF4B of HCoV-229E and ORF3 of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV)  The 1a and 1ab polyproteins are translated from the genomic RNA  but the remaining viral proteins are translated from subgenomic mRNAs made by discontinuous transcription during negative strand synthesis26  Each subgenomic mRNA has a common 5′end  derived from the 5′portion of the genome (the 5′leader sequence)  and common 3′coterminal parts  Discontinuous transcription requires basepairing between cis-acting transcription regulatory sequences (TRSs)  one located near the 5′part of the viral genome (the leader TRS) and others located upstream of each of the respective ORFs (the body TRSs)27  The cDNA bank that we sequenced contained copies of the
subgenomic mRNA for the N protein  thus providing the opportunity to exactly map the leader sequence that is fused to all subgenomic mRNAs  A leader of 72 nucleotides was identified at the 5′UTR  Eleven of twelve nucleotides of the leader TRS (5′-UCUCAACUAAAC-3′) showed similarity with the body TRS upstream of the N gene  Putative TRSs were also identified upstream of the S  ORF3  E and M genes (Supplementary Table 2 online)  We next aligned the sequence of HCoV-NL63 with the complete genomes of other coronaviruses  The percentage nucleotide identity was determined for each gene and is listed in Table 2  All genes except the M gene shared the highest identity with HCoV-229E  To confirm that HCoV-NL63 is a new member of the group 1 coronaviruses  we conducted phylogenetic analysis using the nucleotide sequence of the 1a  1b  S  M and N genes (Fig  4b)  For each gene analyzed  HCoV-NL63 clustered with the group 1 coronaviruses  The 1a  1b and S genes of HCoV-NL63 are most closely related to those of HCoV-229E  However  further inspection revealed a subcluster of HCoV-NL63  HCoV-229E and PEDV  Phylogenetic analysis could not be performed for the ORF3 and E genes because the regions were too variable or too small for analysis  respectively  Bootscan analysis by the Simplot software version 2 5 (ref  28) found no signs of recombination (data not shown)  The presence of a single nonstructural gene between the S and E genes is noteworthy because almost all coronaviruses have two or more ORFs in this region  with the exception of PEDV and HCoV-OC43 (ref  29 30)  Perhaps most notable is a large insert of 537 nucleotides in the 5′portion of the S gene of HcoV-NL63  as compared with that of HCoV-229E  A BLAST search found no similarity between this additional 179–amino acid domain of the S protein and any coronavirus or other sequence deposited in GenBank  An alignment of the HCoV-NL63 S protein sequence with those of other group 1 coronaviruses is shown in Supplementary Figure 4 online  DISCUSSION In this study we present a detailed description of a new human coronavirus  Thus far  only three human coronaviruses have been characterized
if we include SARS-CoV  further characterization of HCoV-NL63 as the fourth member will provide important insight into the variation among human coronaviruses  HCoV-NL63 is a member of the group 1 coronaviruses and is most closely related to HCoV-229E  but the differences between them are prominent  First  they share on average only 65% sequence identity  Second  a single gene  ORF3  in HCoV-NL63 takes the place of the 4A and 4B genes of HCoV-229E  Third  the 5′region of the S gene of HCoV-NL63 contains a large in-frame insertion of 537 nucleotides  The N-terminal region of the S protein has been implicated in binding to aminopeptidase N (group I coronaviruses) and sialic acid31–33  so the 179–amino acid insert in HCoV-NL63 might be involved in receptor binding and may explain the tropism of this virus in cell culture  However  the aminopeptidase N receptor-binding domain of the HCoV-229E S protein has been mapped to amino acids 407–547 (ref  33)  so it seems unlikely that the insertion will be directly involved in binding to aminopeptidase N  Fourth  whereas HCoV-229E is fastidious in cell culture with a narrow host range HCoV-NL63 replicates efficiently in monkey kidney cells  SARS-CoV is also able to replicate in monkey kidney cells (Vero-E6 cells34)  yet the predicted S proteins of SARSCoV and HCoV-NL63 do not share a domain that could explain the in vitro host cell range of these viruses  Other viral proteins may influence the cell tropism of a virus  but none of the HCoV-NL63 proteins were more closely related to SARS-CoV than to HCoV-229E  Variability at the 5′end of the S gene  correlating with alterations in tropism  has also been described for the group 1 coronaviruses porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV)  These porcine viruses are antigenically and genetically related  but their pathogenicity is markedly different  TGEV replicates in and destroys the enterocytes of the small intestine  causing severe diarrhea with high mortality in neonatal swine  In contrast  PRCoV (which emerged more recently than TGEV) has a selective tropism for respiratory tissue  and very little capacity to replicate in intestinal tissue  The difference between the TGEV and PRCoV S gene sequences is comparable to the difference between those of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E35  Compared with TGEV  PRCoV contains a deletion in the 5′hypervariable region of the S gene  The extra region that is present at the 5′end of the TGEV S gene is responsible for the hemagglutination activity of TGEV  and its capacity to bind to sialic acid32  However  this region shows no similarity to the HCoV-NL63 insert  The common cold–causing virus HCoV-229E can cause more serious respiratory disease in infants and immunocompromised patients36 37  Our data indicate that HCoV-NL63 causes acute respiratory disease in children below the age of 1 year  and in immunocompromised adults  To date  no known viral pathogen can be identified in a substantial portion of respiratory disease cases in humans (20–30%  ref  38)  Several assays have been used to diagnose coronavirus infections  Traditionally  an antibody test is implemented to measure a rise in titers of antibodies to the human coronaviruses HCoV-229E or HCoV-OC43 (ref  12)  Antibodies to HCoV-NL63 might cross-react with HCoV-229E  given that these viruses are members of the same serotype  If this were the case  HCoV-NL63 infections might have been misdiagnosed as HCoV-229E  Molecular biology tools such as RT-PCR assays39 40 were designed to selectively detect the human coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43  but these assays will not detect HCoV-NL63  Even the RT-PCR assay that was designed to amplify all known coronaviruses40 is not able to amplify HCoV-NL63 because of several mismatches with the primer sequences  The availability of the complete HCoV-NL63 genome sequence means that these diagnostic assays can be substantially improved  Our results indicate that HCoV-NL63 is present in a significant number of respiratory tract illnesses of unknown etiology  HCoV-NL63 was detected in patients suffering from respiratory disease  with a frequency of up to 7% in January 2003  The virus was not detected in more recent samples collected in the spring and summer of 2003  which correlates with the fact that human coronaviruses tend to be transmitted predominantly in the winter season12  Future experiments with more sensitive diagnostic tools should yield a more accurate picture of the prevalence of this virus and its association with respiratory disease  METHODS VIDISCA method  The virus was cultured on LLC-MK2 cells  Details of virus culture and patient descriptions are available in Supplementary Methods online  To remove residual cells and mitochondria  110 l of virus culture supernatant was spun for 10 min at maximum speed (13 500 r p m ) in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge  To remove chromosomal DNA and mitochondrial DNA from the lysed cells  100 l of supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and treated with DNase I for 45 min at 37 °C (Ambion)  Nucleic acids were extracted as described41  A reverse transcription reaction was performed with random hexamer primers (Amersham Bioscience) and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (MMLV-RT  Invitrogen)  Second-strand DNA synthesis was carried out with Sequenase II (Amersham Bioscience)  without further addition of a primer  A phenol-chloroform extraction was followed by ethanol precipitation  cDNA-AFLP was performed essentially as described4  with some modifications  The doublestranded
DNA was digested with the HinP1I and MseI restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs)  MseI and HinP1I anchors (see below) were subsequently added  along with 5U ligase enzyme (Invitrogen) in the supplied ligase buffer  for 2 h at 37 °C  The MseI and HinP1I anchors were prepared by mixing a top-strand oligonucleotide (5′-CTCGTAGACTGCGTACC-3′for the MseI anchor and 5′-GACGATGAGTCCTGAC-3′for the HinP1I anchor) with a bottom-strand oligonucleotide (5′-TAGGTACGCAGTC-3′for the MseI anchor and 5′- CGGTCAGGACTCAT-3′for the HinP1I anchor) in a 1:40 dilution of ligase buffer  Twenty cycles of PCR were carried out with 10 l of the ligation mixture  100 ng of HinP1I standard primer (5′-GACGATGAGTCCTGACCGC-3′) and 100 ng of MseI standard primer (5′-CTCGTAGACTGCGTACCTAA-3′)  Five microliters of this PCR product was used as input in the second ‘selective’ amplification step  along with 100 ng HinP1I N-primer and 100 ng MseI N-primer (the ‘N’ indicates that the standard primers were extended with one nucleotide  G A  T or C)  The selective rounds of amplification were done using ‘touchdown PCR’: 10 cycles of 94 °C for 60 s  65 °C for 30 s  and 72 °C for 1 min (annealing temperature reduced by 1 °C per cycle)  23 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s  56 °C for 30 s  and 72 °C for 1 min  and finally 1 cycle of 72 °C for 10 min  Sixteen PCR reactions  each with 1 of the 16 primer combinations  were conducted for each sample in this selective PCR  The PCR products were analyzed on 4% Metaphor agarose gels (Cambrex)  and the fragments of interest were cloned and sequenced using BigDye terminator reagents  Electrophoresis and data collection were performed using an ABI 377 instrument  DNA molecular weight markers were from Invitrogen and Eurogentec  To detect HIV-1  we used VIDISCA with EcoRI digestion instead of HinP1I digestion  VIDISCA was modified for parvovirus B19 detection as follows: the reverse transcription step was excluded  only HinP1I digestion and adaptor ligation were performed  the first PCR reaction was performed with 35 cycles instead of 20  and the first PCR fragments were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis  Details of cDNA library construction and full genome sequencing are available in Supplementary Methods online  Diagnostic RT-PCR  A total of 614 respiratory samples were collected from 493 individuals between December 2002 and August 2003 at the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam  The specimens included oral and nasopharyngeal aspirates  throat swabs  bronchoalveolar lavage and sputum  The samples had been collected for routine viral diagnostic screening of people suffering from upper and/or lower respiratory tract diseases  and the patients consented that their samples be used for testing of respiratory viruses that included coronaviruses  We used 100 l of each sample in a Boom extraction41  The diagnostic assay was designed based on the sequence of the 1b gene  The reverse transcription was performed with MMLV-RT (Invitrogen)  using 10 ng of reverse transcription primer (repSZ-RT  5′-CCACTATAAC-3′  coordinate 16232 in HCoV-NL63)  The entire reverse transcription mixture was added to the first PCR mixture containing 100 ng of primer repSZ-1 (5′-GTGATGCATATGCTAATTTG-3′  coordinate 15973) and 100 ng of primer repSZ-3(5′-CTCTTGCAGGTATAATCCTA-3′  coordinate 16210)  The PCR reaction consisted of the following steps: 95 °C for 5 min  then 35 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min  55 °C for 1 min  and 72 °C for 2 min  then 72 °C for 10 min  A nested PCR was started using 5 l of the first PCR product with 100 ng of primer repSZ-2 (5′-TTGGTAAACAAAAGATAACT-3′  coordinate 16012) and 100 ng of primer repSZ-4 (5′-TCAATGCTATAAACAGTCAT-3′  coordinate 16181)  Twenty-five PCR cycles were performed using the same profile as the first PCR  Ten microliters of each PCR product was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis  All positive samples were repeated and sequenced to confirm the presence of HCoV-NL63  To verify negative and positive PCR results  an additional diagnostic RT-PCR assay was conducted using the 1a gene primers 5′-AATATGTCTAACAAATAAAACGATT-3′(reverse transcriptase primer P4H10-3  coordinate 6667)  5′-CTTTTGATAACGGTCACTATG-3′(SS 5852-5P  coordinate 5777) and 5′-CTCATTACATAAAACATCAAACGG-3′(P4G1M-5-3P  coordinate 6616) in the first PCR  and 5′-GGTCACTATGTAGTTTATGATG-3′(P3E2-5P  coordinate 5788) and 5′-GGATTTTTCATAACCACTTAC-3′(SS 6375-3P  coordinate 6313) in the nested PCR  Details of sequence analysis are available in Supplementary Methods online  GenBank accession numbers  The HCoV-NL63 sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers AY567487–AY567494 ";van der Hoek  Lia  Pyrc  Krzysztof  Jebbink  Maarten F  Vermeulen-Oost  Wilma  Berkhout2  Ron J M  Wolthers  Katja C  Wertheim-van Dillen  Pauline M E  Kaandorp  Jos  Spaargaren  Joke   Berkhout  Ben;Identification of a new coronavirus;Nature Medicine;something
